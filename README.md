### About A-Frame
A-Frame can achieve native-like latency and framerate with proper browsers (e.g., Firefox with WebVR). For example, A-Painter is Tilt Brush in the browser that can smoothly run 90 frames per second and can be indiscernible from native.

A-Frame being based on HTML is not an issue. While the browserâ€™s 2D layout has been a primary performance concern for normal web applications, A-Frame uses Custom Elements to act merely as data containers and does not trigger the layout engine. 3D operations are done in memory with minimal overhead and are rendered with WebGL, which binds to OpenGL or Direct3D.
